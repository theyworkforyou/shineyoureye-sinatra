## Design Decisions

These are some of the design decisions we took when building
this app:

* Since this app is an exemplar, the most important thing we
  keep in mind is to separate site-specific code from generic
  code (for example, the posts and post pages are generic, but
  the route to the posts page or the post page is
  site-specific). Anything that is site-specific is passed as an
  argument. That way, we keep a separation of concerns. This
  will also help do a cleaner extract of a generic core for
  future code re-use.

* We avoid having logic in the routes or in the views, the only
  code there should be to create objects and wire up
  dependencies or jump to the next route. We prefer to separate
  all our logic from the framework, so that the code is
  portable, testable and decoupled. We put all the logic in
  service objects instead. Example: if you find yourself
  formatting a string or a date in a view, that should probably
  go in the view's page class instead, so that you can just do
  `@page.text` or `@page.date` in the view and it will have the
  right format. See for example,
  [this guide for Rails](https://8thlight.com/blog/christoph-gockel/2016/10/26/getting-rails-on-track-part-2-views.html)
  (which is applicable here). We do this for separation of
  concerns as well.

* For the same reasons, the service objects are independent of
  Sinatra and know nothing about it, so there should be no
  Sinatra exceptions or anything framework-related in this
  code. If you took these classes out and put them into a Rails
  or Middleman app, for example, they should work with very
  small tweaks.

* Related with the previous point, and to avoid complexity,
  [we only pass ONE object to the views](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers#only-instantiate-one-object-in-the-controller). That
  object is usually an instance of a page. Its public methods
  return everything that the view needs to render.

* We have a lot of different sources of data that we use to
  display information on the pages, so keeping a clear
  separation of the classes by function (see the **Code
  structure** section below) is very important to keep the code
  manageable and prevent changes to cascade through a lot of
  unrelated parts of the codebase.

* We avoid coupling classes (and tests) too much, some coupling
  is inevitable, but we try to keep it low. Dependency injection
  is your friend.

* There are different opinions about this, but we avoid comments
  and only use them when there is a need to explain why we did
  something. If you add a comment because what the code is doing
  is obscure, that is a code smell and it is better to refactor
  the code and make it more readable (and hence maintainable).

* The site specific settings are separated from the site using
  a hash whose keys are converted to methods for ease of use. this
  hash is passed to the classes in their constructor so that we
  don't keep adding arguments to it, but instead the class takes
  care of what it needs from the hash.


## Code structure

It is unlikely that any of our Pombola-lite sites in the future
will have the level of complexity of this particular site. We
have a lot of different sources of data and also this is a port
from an existing Pombola site, so we need to keep some things
from there as well.

However the principles we used to separate the different
concerns are generic and could suit simpler sites.

* We use namespacing to distinguish all the different parts of
  the application.

* The code is organized as follows:
  * **page classes**, which are consumed by the views
  * **service classes**, where the logic of the application lives

  The page classes often use service objects to do their
  job. These are passed to the page classes using dependency
  injection.

* Both the service classes and the page classes live under
  `lib`. The data (prose documents, CSV files, JSON files, etc.)
  lives under the root directory in their corresponding folders
  (`prose`, `mapit`, `morph`, etc.)

### Service classes

#### Document

These are the classes that contain the logic to parse a
document. A document in this app refers to user-editable content
like posts, events, info pages and summaries. These are saved as
markdown documents with YAML frontmatter, which are read from
the `prose` directory.

[The YAML fields in these documents](https://github.com/theyworkforyou/shineyoureye-sinatra/blob/master/lib/document/frontmatter_parser.rb)
map to prose fields in
[the prose configuration file](https://github.com/theyworkforyou/shineyoureye-prose/blob/gh-pages/_prose.yml). The
prose fields are different for each type of document and their
values are set by the user through the prose graphic interface.


#### EP and MembershipCSV

These are the classes used to parse data about politicians. The
EP classes encapsulate data coming from the
[EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/) project. The
MembershipCSV classes encapsulate data coming from a CSV file,
usually one produced by a scraper running at
[Morph](https://morph.io/).

We keep both separated into two different classes for the
reasons stated in the previous section, but both types should
keep the same API.

#### MapIt

Although we can get the areas associated with politicians from
the EveryPolitician project or from the CSV files, we map those
to [MapIt data](http://nigeria.mapit.mysociety.org) and use the
information from MapIt instead.

Hence, in this folder we keep all the classes to parse and
encapsulate the data coming from MapIt and the mappings of MapIt
areas with areas obtained from elsewhere. Ideally this could be
extracted into its own gem in the future after some work, but
for now it lives here.

#### Collection/Finder classes and entity classes

The service classes are usually organized into collection/finder
classes and entity classes.

Collection classes represent a list of entities of a certain
type. These classes can be used to find a particular entity and
return either a single entity or a list of entities. Their
corresponding page class will use one of them.

They are used in routes that are a list of things, for example,
the list of posts, the list of people or the list of
areas. Examples of collection clases are `Document::Finder` (for
document entities),
`EP::PeopleByLegislature`/`MembershipCSV::People` (for person
entities) and `Mapit::Wrapper` (for place entities).
